This is a test for setting up python with Poetry.
In main.ipynb you will find a segmented script which creates clean and noisy sinusoid data for classification
This data is then split into training and testing sets
Using NCA as an embedding method with KNN classifying, clean and noisy data may be categorised
Finally an outside test is conducted with a new piece of data not seen by the ML, one clean and one noisy.
