This is a test for setting up python with Poetry.

Provided you have Poetry installed and added to your $PATH.
This can be checked by typing "poetry --version" in a Windows Powershell.
A venv will be created by running "poetry install" 
This should install all the required dependencies, afterwards simply set the interpreter to access the .venv.

In main.ipynb you will find a segmented script which creates clean and noisy sinusoid data for classification
This data is then split into training and testing sets
Using NCA as an embedding method with KNN classifying, clean and noisy data may be categorised
Finally an outside test is conducted with a new piece of data not seen by the ML, one clean and one noisy.
